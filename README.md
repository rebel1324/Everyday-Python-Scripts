# Everyday Python Scripts
This is just everyday python scripts. Does not cares about execution efficiency (when it's just used for few times), just useful for everyday use.

Mainly focusing on practicing automation methods and see how I can actually save my time and do less mosue/keyboard works and tedious tasks.

If you have any idea to solve automations, you can add some of ideas on Issues page.
# List of scripts

This script was made for sorting the subtitle files and video files in sync so the video player can detect the subtitle file without the hassle. All you have to do is just copy this thing and put on your anime folder and run the file.
pretty efficient for merging external subtitles. (especially you, korean boy)

**notification / automation / task efficiency**

My personal sprint timer. when this script executed it will notify me 90 minutes of work time and 30 minutes of rest time.
## mana.py
**notification / automation / scrap websites**

My personal manga notification program. When this script executed it will notify me new mangas that i've missed via telegram. The source is undisclosed. e-mail me if you need to know the parsing source. 
riddled with inefficient code - since I don't want to get blocked from the site, async/multithread never used.
# Tips
These scripts are designed to be some kind of generic tools for your windows environment. I suggest you to put some of these scripst on some folder and add that path on PATH enviornment variable.
So you can actually call the program anywhere freely.
